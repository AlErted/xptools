					X-PLANE SCENERY TOOLS RELEASE NOTES


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCENERY TOOLS MARCH 08
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is the first release of the combined X-Plane scenery tools.  This 
distribution combines the following tools into one package:

- DSF2Text (now renamed DSFTool)
- ObjConverter
- ObjView

This release also introduces three new tools:

- XGrinder replaces the UI versions of ObjConveter and DSF2Text, providing a
  single drag & drop interface to all of the command-line file converters.
  
- DDSTool provides high quality X-Plane cmopatible PNG->DDS conversion for 
  Mac and Windows.
  
- MeshTool allows you to build base meshes with orthophotos from your own GIS
  data.
  
At this point WorldEditor and the AC3D export plugin are stil separate
releases.

INSTALLATION, SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS AND LICENSING
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The scenery tools simply need to be unzipped somewhere on your hard drive.  In
order for XGrinder to provide a UI around the command-line tools, all of the 
tools need to stay in the same directory.

The scenery tools should work on any computer that can run X-Plane 864.

The scenery tools are open source; code original to Laminar Research is 
availble via the MIT/X11 license; various required libraries have licenses
that are compatible with either MIT/X11 or GPL.

The source code for these tools is all available at:
