LIB SRC NOTESThese libraries are all open source (GPL/LGPL/X11/QPL) libraries used for variousparts of the scenery system and related tools.Organization:Each of these libraries is built individually as static libraries with a few exceptions: - ZLib has the "minizip" unzip and zip routines compiled in from the contrib folder. - CGAL does not have all of the classes provided since we don't need GMP support, etc. - JPEG does not have the file converter code compiled in. - libTiff, libGeoTiff and Proj4 have been combined into one master libGeoTiff library.Licensing:X11 indicates an X-11 style license, e.g. no copying restrictions, but notnecessarily the specific original MIT/X11 license.zlib-1.1.4			X11libgeotiff-1.2.2	X11tiff-v3.6.1			X11PROJ.4				X11libpng-1.2.5		X11lib3ds-1.2.0		LGPLexpat				X11dime				GPL (author says now LGPL!)jpeg-6b				X11CGAL-3.0			QPLshapelib-1.2.
